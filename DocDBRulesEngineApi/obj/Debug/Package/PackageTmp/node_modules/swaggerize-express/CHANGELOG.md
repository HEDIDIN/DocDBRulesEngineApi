### 3.0.0

- Swagger 2.0 compatible.
- Generator has been removed. See the yeoman generator `generator-swaggerize` instead.
- `docspath` defaults to `/api-docs`.
- `setUrl` is now `setHost` and is used to set `host` and `port` in the `api`.
- `app._api` is `app.api`.
- `api` and `setHost` are now on the `parent`, not the middleware.

See `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0` branches for addition changelogs.
